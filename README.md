## KEY INSIGHTS
* Furniture profits grew from $558 (2021) to $10,905 (2024), while Electronics declined from $6,373 to $1,088, showing high volatility.
* Product margins vary significantly - Wireless Mouse (20.1%) and Mouse Pad (20%) have highest margins, while Printers lag at 11.8%.
* Top customers drive substantial revenue - Theo Dunn leads Electronics ($7,200), Lila Hart ($4,570) and Lyric James ($4,250) dominate Furniture sales.
* Discounting strategy needs refinement - Electronics get higher discounts (10.78%) than Furniture (9.89%), with excessive discounting directly reducing profit margins on electronics.
* Only two customers made repeat purchases across years (Theo Dunn-Laptops, Finn Cole-Headphones), indicating mostly one-time product buyers.
* Electronics face market pressures - High competition, discount dependency, and product obsolescence make Electronics less stable than Furniture's consistent demand.
* 2024 shows mixed performance - $160,740 revenue and $24,737 profit from 927 units, but Electronics continued fluctuating while Furniture maintained momentum.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
* Optimize Discounts : Limit discounts above 10% on low-margin products; test 5-10% on high-margin items.
* Prioritize Products : Increase inventory/marketing for high-margin items (Wireless Mouse, Sofas); reprice/phase out low-margin Printers.
* Target Key Customers : Offer loyalty programs for Electronics customers; provide bulk discounts for Furniture buyers.
* Focus on Furniture : Expand 2024 high-quantity items (Chairs/Desks); investigate Electronics decline.
* Scale up Inventory & Bundles : (Desk + Chair packages). Explore cross-selling (e.g., “Buy a Desk → 10% off on Monitor/Keyboard”) to connect both categories.
